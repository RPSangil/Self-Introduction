## Self Introduction

### Who am I? What is my background?
My name is Raelyn Sangil. I was born and raised here in Australia. My cultural background is Phillipino. My work background is mainly focused on customer service but over the last 5 years all my employment has been centred around Financial Advising. I currently work at CBA as a Customer Service Representative and assist customers with their financial needs as a first line of contact. Previously I worked at Fox Symes qualifying customers for debt solution assitance.

### What are your career goals?
I find analysis facinating and would like to explore Business and Customer Risk Analysis in more detail. I have also considered being a Financial advisor.

### Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?
I strongly believe that the financial industry needs to adapt and become more innovative when it comes to helping businesses and custoemrs. FinTech is an amazing opportunity to drive these changes and I want to be a part of that change.
